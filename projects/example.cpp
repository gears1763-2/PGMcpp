     *  1. construct Model object
     *
     *  This block constructs a Model object, which is the central container for the 
     *  entire microgrid model.
     *
     *  The fist argument that must be provided to the Model constructor is a valid
     *  path (either relative or absolute) to a time series of electrical load data.
     *  For an example of the expected format, see 
     *
     *  data/test/electrical_load/electrical_load_generic_peak-500kW_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
     *
     *  Note that the length of the given electrical load time series defines the
     *  modelled project life (so if you want to model n years of microgrid operation,
     *  then you must pass a path to n years worth of electrical load data). In addition,
     *  the given electrical load time series defines which points in time are modelled.
     *  As such, all subsequent time series data which is passed in must (1) be of the
     *  same length as the electrical load time series, and (2) provide data for the
     *  same set of points in time. Of course, the electrical load time series can be
     *  of arbitrary length, and it need not be a uniform time series.
     *
     *  The second argument that one can provide is the desired disptach control mode.
     *  If nothing is given here, then the model will default to simple load following
     *  control. However, one can stipulate which control mode to use by altering the
     *  control_mode attribute of the ModelInputs structure. In this case, the
     *  cycle charging control mode is being set.

     *  2. add Diesel objects to Model
     *
     *  This block defines and adds a set of diesel generators to the Model object.
     *
     *  In this example, a single DieselInputs structure is used to define and add 
     *  three diesel generators to the model.
     *
     *  The first diesel generator is defined as a 300 kW generator (which shows an 
     *  example of how to access and alter an encapsulated attribute of DieselInputs).
     *  In addition, the diesel generator is taken to be a sunk cost (and so no capital
     *  cost is incurred in the first time step; the opposite is true for non-sunk
     *  assets).
     *
     *  The last two diesel generators are defined as 150 kW each. Likewise, they are
     *  also sunk assets (since the same DieselInputs structure is being re-used without
     *  overwriting the is_sunk attribute).
     *
     *  For more details on the various attributes of DieselInputs, refer to the
     *  PGMcpp manual. For instance, note that no economic inputs are given; in this
     *  example, the default values apply.

     *  3. add renewable resources to Model
     *
     *  This block adds a set of renewable resource time series to the Model object.
     *
     *  The first resource added is a solar resource time series, which gives 
     *  horizontal irradiance [kW/m2] at each point in time. Again, remember that all
     *  given time series must align with the electrical load time series (i.e., same
     *  length, same points). For an example of the expected format, see
     *
     *  data/test/resources/solar_GHI_peak-1kWm2_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
     *
     *  Finally, note the declaration of a solar resource key. This variable will be
     *  re-used later to associate a solar PV array object with this particular solar
     *  resource. This method of key association between resource and asset allows for
     *  greater flexibility in modelling production assets that are exposed to different
     *  renewable resources (due to being geographically separated, etc.).
     *
     *  The second resource added is a tidal resource time series, which gives tidal
     *  stream speed [m/s] at each point in time. For an example of the expected format,
     *  see
     *
     *  data/test/resources/tidal_speed_peak-3ms_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
     *
     *  Again, note the tidal resource key.
     *
     *  The third resource added is a wave resource time series, which gives significant
     *  wave height [m] and energy period [s] at each point in time. For an example of
     *  the expected format, see
     *
     *  data/test/resources/waves_H_s_peak-8m_T_e_peak-15s_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
     *
     *  Again, note the wave resource key.
     *
     *  The fourth resource added is a wind resource time series, which gives wind speed
     *  [m/s] at each point in time. For an example of the expected format, see
     *
     *  data/test/resources/wind_speed_peak-25ms_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
     *
     *  Again, note the wind resource key.
     *
     *  The fifth resource added is a hydro resource time series, which gives inflow
     *  rate [m3/hr] at each point in time. For an example of the expected format, see
     *
     *  data/test/resources/hydro_inflow_peak-20000m3hr_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
     *
     *  Again, note the hydro resource key.

     *  with the previously given solar resource series by way of the solar resource

     *  speed of the asset (i.e., the speed at which the rated capacity is achieved) is

     *  example, the installed wind capacity is set to 150 kW. In addition, the design
     *  speed of the asset is not given, and so will default to 8 m/s. Note the

     *  resource key.
