"""
    1. construct Model object
    
    This block constructs a Model object, which is the central container for the 
    entire microgrid model.
    
    The fist argument that must be provided to the Model constructor is a valid
    path (either relative or absolute) to a time series of electrical load data.
    For an example of the expected format, see 
    
    data/test/electrical_load/electrical_load_generic_peak-500kW_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
    
    Note that the length of the given electrical load time series defines the
    modelled project life (so if you want to model n years of microgrid operation,
    then you must pass a path to n years worth of electrical load data). In addition,
    the given electrical load time series defines which points in time are modelled.
    As such, all subsequent time series data which is passed in must (1) be of the
    same length as the electrical load time series, and (2) provide data for the
    same set of points in time. Of course, the electrical load time series can be
    of arbitrary length, and it need not be a uniform time series.
    
    The second argument that one can provide is the desired disptach control mode.
    If nothing is given here, then the model will default to simple load following
    control. However, one can stipulate which control mode to use by altering the
    control_mode attribute of the ModelInputs structure. In this case, the
    cycle charging control mode is being set.

"""
    2. add Diesel objects to Model
    
    This block defines and adds a set of diesel generators to the Model object.
    
    In this example, a single DieselInputs structure is used to define and add 
    three diesel generators to the model.
    
    The first diesel generator is defined as a 300 kW generator (which shows an 
    example of how to access and alter an encapsulated attribute of DieselInputs).
    In addition, the diesel generator is taken to be a sunk cost (and so no capital
    cost is incurred in the first time step; the opposite is true for non-sunk
    assets).
    
    The last two diesel generators are defined as 150 kW each. Likewise, they are
    also sunk assets (since the same DieselInputs structure is being re-used without
    overwriting the is_sunk attribute).
    
    For more details on the various attributes of DieselInputs, refer to the
    PGMcpp manual. For instance, note that no economic inputs are given; in this
    example, the default values apply.

"""
    3. add renewable resources to Model
    
    This block adds a set of renewable resource time series to the Model object.
    
    The first resource added is a solar resource time series, which gives 
    horizontal irradiance [kW/m2] at each point in time. Again, remember that all
    given time series must align with the electrical load time series (i.e., same
    length, same points). For an example of the expected format, see
    
    data/test/resources/solar_GHI_peak-1kWm2_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
    
    Finally, note the declaration of a solar resource key. This variable will be
    re-used later to associate a solar PV array object with this particular solar
    resource. This method of key association between resource and asset allows for
    greater flexibility in modelling production assets that are exposed to different
    renewable resources (due to being geographically separated, etc.).
    
    The second resource added is a tidal resource time series, which gives tidal
    stream speed [m/s] at each point in time. For an example of the expected format,
    see
    
    data/test/resources/tidal_speed_peak-3ms_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
    
    Again, note the tidal resource key.
    
    The third resource added is a wave resource time series, which gives significant
    wave height [m] and energy period [s] at each point in time. For an example of
    the expected format, see
    
    data/test/resources/waves_H_s_peak-8m_T_e_peak-15s_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
    
    Again, note the wave resource key.
    
    The fourth resource added is a wind resource time series, which gives wind speed
    [m/s] at each point in time. For an example of the expected format, see
    
    data/test/resources/wind_speed_peak-25ms_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
    
    Again, note the wind resource key.
    
    The fifth resource added is a hydro resource time series, which gives inflow
    rate [m3/hr] at each point in time. For an example of the expected format, see
    
    data/test/resources/hydro_inflow_peak-20000m3hr_1yr_dt-1hr.csv
    
    Again, note the hydro resource key.

    5. add Renewable objects to Model
    
    This block defines and adds a set of renewable production assets to the Model
    object.
    
    The first block defines and adds a solar PV array to the Model object. In this
    example, the installed solar capacity is set to 250 kW. Note the association
    with the previously given solar resource series by way of the solar resource
    key. Also, note that this asset is not taken as sunk (as the is_sunk attribute
    of the SolarInputs structure is unchanged and thus defaults to true). As such,
    this asset will incur a capital cost in the first time step.
    
    For more details on the various attributes of SolarInputs, refer to the PGMcpp
    manual. For instance, note that no economic inputs are given; in this
    example, the default values apply.
    
    The second block defines and adds a tidal turbine to the Model object. In this
    example, the installed tidal capacity is set to 120 kW. In addition, the design
    speed of the asset (i.e., the speed at which the rated capacity is achieved) is
    set to 2.5 m/s. Note the association with the previously given tidal resource
    series by way of the tidal resource key.
    
    For more details on the various attributes of TidalInputs, refer to the PGMcpp
    manual. For instance, note that no economic inputs are given; in this
    example, the default values apply.
    
    The third block defines and adds a wind turbine to the Model object. In this
    example, the installed wind capacity is set to 150 kW. In addition, the design
    speed of the asset is not given, and so will default to 8 m/s. Note the
    association with the previously given tidal resource series by way of the wind
    resource key.
    
    For more details on the various attributes of WindInputs, refer to the PGMcpp
    manual. For instance, note that no economic inputs are given; in this

    In this example, the installed wave capacity is set to 100 kW. Note the
    association with the previously given wave resource series by way of the wave
    resource key.
